        Accelerating global decarbonization through emissionality: an example
        from reducing landfill methane emissions
      </h1>
      <p className="max-w-[650px] m-auto ">
        Decarbonization strategies often base emissions-reduction interventions
        on two assumptions — working locally and focusing on the largest
        emitters. This inherently limits the impact these projects can have. A
        superior approach is called emissionality, a decarbonization strategy
        that focuses on investing in interventions that can yield the greatest
        emissions reduction, regardless of their physical location around the
        world.
      </p>
      <p className="max-w-[650px] m-auto">
        In this example, we show how emissionality can nearly double real-world
        emissions reductions. Deployed at scale and across sectors, the
        additional decarbonization benefit is measured in gigatons annually.

        Example: Landfill methane emissions
      </h3>
      <p className="max-w-[650px] m-auto">
        For this example, we focus on landfill methane emissions in particular.
        In practice more broadly, such an emissionality approach can be taken
        for decarbonization in any given sector, such as power (electricity
        generation) or steel — or even across sectors.
      </p>
      <p className="max-w-[650px] m-auto">
        Methane is a potent but shorter-lived greenhouse gas (GHG), with a
        global warming potential (GWP) some 85 times stronger than carbon
        dioxide on a 20-year time scale, and still 25 times stronger than CO2 on
        a 100-year time horizon. Thus, near-term methane emissions reductions
        can have an outsized beneficial influence on overall climate action.
      </p>
      <p className="max-w-[650px] m-auto">
        The waste sector is one of the largest human-made sources of methane.
        Landfill emissions can be reduced in several ways, such as by upgrading
        a landfill from an unmanaged disposal site to a covered sanitary
        landfill.
      </p>
      <p className="max-w-[650px] m-auto">
        Capping landfills with various materials traps much of the methane they
        create, improving local air quality and preventing the methane from
        being directly released to the atmosphere where it contributes to the
        climate crisis. Capping also provides a pathway for capturing landfill
        gas (LFG), enabling LFG-to-energy uses, also.
      </p>

        What if we could cap 100 Landfills?
      </h3>
      <p className="max-w-[650px] m-auto">
        Let’s imagine the funds and political will have come together amongst
        the UN’s Annex I (historically industrialized) nations to cap 100
        landfills. Climate TRACE uses AI and public data to track and
        characterize 9,624 landfills worldwide. The Annex I nations have
        recognized the potential to cut planet-heating emissions and are
        evaluating options for how to best prioritize this group of just over 1%
        of all landfills tracked by Climate TRACE.
      </p>
      <p className="max-w-[650px] m-auto">
        Scenario 1: Two assumptions In our first scenario, these nations make
        two reasonable-seeming assumptions: Work locally: Collective global
        climate action often focuses on countries taking steps to reduce their
        own individual emissions, such as through Nationally Determined
        Contributions (NDCs). Corporations often apply a similar, localized
        approach to decarbonizing their operational footprint and supply chain.
        Focusing on most-emitting landfills: Landfills with the greatest
        emissions among Annex I countries would, at first glance, seem to be the
        best candidates to be capped. Now we evaluate the net climate impact of
        these assumptions.
